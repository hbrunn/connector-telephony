This module allows configuring multiple providers for sending SMS.

By restricting providers to country or area codes, you can ie have Odoo
pick different providers for different countries.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Settings / Technical / Phone/SMS / SMS providers
2. Create/Edit providers, reorder them, restrict some provider to
   certain country or area codes

Usage
=====

This module doesn't do anything on its own, it is meant to be used by
developers to implement SMS providers.

To do this, it suffices to inherit the ``ir.sms.gateway`` model to add a
type:

::

   gateway_type = fields.Selection(selection_add=[("your_sms_provider", "Your SMS provider")])

and declare a function named like \_send\_$type:

::

   def _send_your_sms_provider(self, messages):
       # do here whatever you need to send the list of messages:
       # [{
       #    'id': id of the sms.sms record (may not be set),
       #    'number': the number to send the sms to
       #    'content': the content of the message
       # }]
       # return a list of dicts with sending results:
       # [{
       #    'id': id of the sms.sms record
       #    'state': sms.sms#state
       #    'failure_type': sms.sms#failure_type if state == 'error'
       #    # whatever other fields you want to write on the sms.sms record after sending,
       #    # such as provider-specific extra information
       # }]

Probably your provider needs some api key or similar to function, add
those fields prefixed with your gateway_type name to the gateway class:

::

   your_sms_provider_apikey = fields.Char('API key')

and add a group after group ``general`` in the form view of the model:

::

   <group name="general" position="after">
       <group name="your_sms_provider" attrs="{'invisible': [('gateway_type', '!=', 'your_sms_provider')]}">
           <field name="your_sms_provider_apikey" password="True" attrs="{'required': [('gateway_type', '=', 'your_sms_provider')]}" />
       </group>
   </group>
